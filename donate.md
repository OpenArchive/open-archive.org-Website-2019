<p>If you would like to better manage your mobile media, are a human rights defender,  or represent an NGO or other organization interested in collaborating, please let us know. We are always interested in finding new partners to work with.</p>
<p><i>Note: this project receives grants and sub-contracts from organizations (such as the Open Technology Fund) that receive funding from the U.S. Government and other governments around the world. None of this funding has modified or shaped our development plans, and we would never, ever put any sort of backdoor or compromised component into our software based on this funding.</i></p>
