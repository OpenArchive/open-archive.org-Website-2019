<p>The OpenArchive team is proud to announce the launch of SAVE, our new integrated suite of privacy-enhancing technologies for digital media preservation. 

SAVE was created to enable individuals and organizations to streamline their phone-captured media management, enhance their digital content collaboration and provide a secure archiving solution.  From social networks to video hosting platforms, much of the go-to media hosting platforms are monetized by invasive adtech, driven by surveillance features and subjected to arbitrary content takedowns. SAVE was created to safeguard media for long-term preservation, and protect identity of those who capture. Special attention was paid to threats that individuals working around the world may encounter, from internet shutdowns and device confiscations to limited bandwidth and data loss.

The brainchild of our director, Natalie Cadranel, the OpenArchive’s journey to launch of our new flagship project SAVE was undertaken with deliberate care, patient research and with an emphasis on cutting-edge digital archiving practices. With a mission to provide an alternative hosting framework to commercially available products, SAVE puts control of the digital media captured by mobile phones back in the hands of our users. With native functionalities that include metadata controls and Creative Commons licensing, SAVE was built to streamline a user experience that is intuitive for both individual and organizational users.

We couldn’t be where we are today without a wonderful community of supporters, many of whom have volunteered their time to help us design a tool with our end-users safety, security and diverse circumstances in mind. We are also grateful to generous funders like the Knight Foundation and the Open Technology Fund who have help OpenArchive continue to develop tools, integrate best practices, and iterate designs over the past years. 

Over the coming year, the SAVE team will continue to engage with our community, offer trainings, improved documentation, share our expertise, and advocate for open archiving frameworks that allow people to store and manage their content outside the walled gardens of proprietary Silicon Valley companies.

Next week, OpenArchive will demo at  RightsCon in Tunis. We look forward to giving user trainings and receiving comments to assist us in continually iterating on our app in order to ensure SAVE provides the functionality our users require and ensures that users have a secure framework to manage their digital media outside of the surveillance capitalism-driven media management systems currently on the market.
