<p>The OpenArchive team is proud to announce the launch of <span class="appName">Save</span></a>, our new integrated suite of privacy-enhancing technologies for digital media preservation.

<span class="appName">Save</span></a> enables individuals and organizations to streamline their phone-captured media management, enhance their digital content collaboration, and make it easier to securely archive community and sensitive media. From social networks to video hosting platforms, much of the go-to media hosting platforms are monetized by invasive adtech, driven by surveillance features, and subjected to arbitrary content takedowns. We created <span class="appName">Save</span></a>  to authenticate and safeguard media for long-term preservation and protect the identity of those sharing their documentation. While researching and creating the tool with the communities it serves, we paid special attention to threats that individuals working around the world increasingly encounter, such as internet shutdowns, device confiscations, censorship, limited bandwidth, and data loss.

While embarking on OpenArchive’s journey to launch our new flagship tool <span class="appName">Save</span></a>, we were deliberately careful to incorporate feedback from our extensive ethnographic research, and with an emphasis on cutting-edge digital archiving practices. With a mission to provide an alternative hosting framework to commercially available products, <span class="appName">Save</span></a> puts control of the digital media captured by mobile phones back in the hands of citizen journalists and others risking their freedom to share their stories. With native functionalities that include metadata controls and Creative Commons licensing, <span class="appName">Save</span></a> was built to streamline a user experience that is intuitive for both individuals and organizations.

We couldn’t be where we are today without a wonderful community of supporters, many of whom have volunteered their time to help us design a tool with our end-users safety, security and diverse circumstances in mind. We are also grateful to generous funders like the Knight Foundation and the Open Technology Fund who have help OpenArchive continue to develop tools, integrate best practices, and iterate designs over the past years. 

Over the coming year, the <span class="appName">Save</span></a> team will continue to engage with our community, offer trainings, improved documentation, share our expertise, and advocate for open archiving frameworks that allow people to store and manage their content outside the walled gardens of proprietary Silicon Valley companies.

Next week, OpenArchive will demo <span class="appName">Save</span></a> at RightsCon in Tunis. We look forward to giving user trainings and receiving comments to assist us in continually iterating on our app in order to ensure SAVE provides the functionality our users require and ensures that users have a secure framework to manage their digital media outside of the surveillance capitalism-driven media management systems currently on the market.
