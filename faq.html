    <div class="heading"><h2>What is Save?</h2></div>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="appName">Save</span> is a mobile app designed to help users preserve, protect, and amplify audio/visual media. It is one of OpenArchive’s projects and is free, open-source, and currently available for Android with iOS coming Summer 2019. Functionalities include adding metadata and Creative Commons licensing to audio/visual mobile media and sending it to the Internet Archive and other archives over the privacy-focused Tor network.</p>

<p><span class="appName">Save</span> is an easy-to-use app designed by OpenArchive to help you store, share, and amplify your mobile media while ensuring your identity remains protected. It's also free, open-source, and available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/save-by-openarchive/id1462212414">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.opendasharchive.openarchive.release&hl=en">Android</a>. Through the app you can add metadata and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons<a/> licensing to your audio or visual mobile media, and then send it over TLS and the privacy-focused <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> network to the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> 
  or other private archives to be saved.</p>
<p><span class="appName">Save</span> protects your freedom of speech by leveraging a suite of privacy-enhancing technologies to safeguard your media and identity in the event of internet shutdowns, surveillance, device confiscations, content takedowns, limited bandwidth, and data loss. It also assures continued access to your saved media in years to come.</p>

    <div class="heading"><h2>What can Save do?</h2></div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Unlike other media-sharing tools, <span class="appName">Save</span> offers a suite of responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on community input and a commitment to usability and digital inclusion. With <span class="appName">Save</span> you can:
        <br>

      <p><i><b>Authenticate Media</b></i>: With <span class="appName">Save</span>, you can be sure your media is always authenticated because you have full control—without interference from intermediaries—from phone to archive. And, when paired with <a href="https://guardianproject.info/2017/02/24/combating-fake-news-with-a-smartphone-proof-mode/">Proofmode</a> (available now for Android, iOS coming soon), you can even add sensor data to corroborate the metadata captured alongside your media.</p>

      <p><i><b>Send Media via Secure Transit</b></i>: <span class="appName">Save</span> always uses TLS to ensure in-transit security and encryption. And, when you enable <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> for mobile (either via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android">Orbot: Tor for Android</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448">Onion Browser</a> for iOS ), you add an additional layer of protection to ensure no one can intercept your media as it travels from your phone to the Internet Archive or your server of choice.</p>

      <p><i><b>Preserve Mobile Media for Long-Term Storage</b></i>: When you use <span class="appName">Save</span> to archive your mobile media in a trusted repository committed to longevity and interoperability (such as the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> or <a href="https://owncloud.org/">OwnCloud</a>), you ensure unobstructed access to it for generations to come. This stands in stark contrast to popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.</p>

      <p><i><b>Communicate Your Intentions for Future Use</b></i>: Through Save you can grant access to your shared media and communicate your intentions for future use by easily generating a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license allowing for others to reuse or remix your work.</p>

      <p><i><b>Simplify Organizational Workflows</b></i>: <span class="appName">Save</span>’s easy-to-use design allows teams, as well as individuals, to seamlessly streamline media from many phones into organized folders unique to each contributor.</p>

      <p><i><b>Add Metadata and Flag Significant Content</b></i>: <span class="appName">Save</span> lets you add metadata to your archived media like location, people, and notes. You can also flag certain media as “significant” as a reminder to yourself, or to prepare reviewers for what they will see.</p>
      
      <p><i><b>Import Media from Other Apps</b></i>: <span class="appName">Save</span> allows you to import and share media from other apps on your phone, including audio, notes, and pdfs.</p>
      
      <p><i><b>Store Copies in Multiple Locations</b></i>: With <span class="appName">Save</span> you can further protect your media by creating and storing multiple copies on different secure servers. Whether hosting locally or remotely, your data can be encrypted on the backend and only accessible by you and those you authorize.</p>

      <p><i><b>View Progress and Prioritize Uploads</b></i>: When storing media via <span class="appName">Save</span>, you can watch how much content has been uploaded and prioritize particular media over others.

    <div class="heading"><h2>What can’t Save do</h2></div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Although <span class="appName">Save</span> has many unique features, it can’t do everything. When using the app, please be aware of the following limitations: 

       <p><span class="appName">Save</span> <i><b>does not provide storage space or server space</b></i>: You will need to set up your own server, use the Internet Archive (for free), or DropBox to create and store your collections.</p>

      <p><i><b><span class="appName">Save</span> does not provide on-device encryption</b></i>: When you use <span class="appName">Save</span>, the app pulls in thumbnails of your media to facilitate project organization. Once organized into projects and uploaded to the server, all media is sent over an encrypted connection.</p>

      <p><i><b><span class="appName">Save</span> does not delete original copies of media from your camera roll. Once media has been sent to a server, it will be removed from the <span class="appName">Save</span> app, but the original content will remain in your camera roll.</p>

      <p><i><b><span class="appName">Save</span> <i>does not capture media in-app</i>. <span class="appName">Save</span> works with existing media from your camera roll and other apps (such as voice memos) on your mobile phone.</p>

      <p><i><b><span class="appName">Save</span> <i>does not have an in-app killswitch</i>. Uninstalling the app will remove all local copies of media/metadata stored in the app and all local configurations and settings, including account information.</p>

    <div class="heading"><h2>What is the difference between OpenArchive and the Internet Archive (Archive.org)?</h2></div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The Internet Archive (archive.org) is a non-profit digital library offering free universal access to books, movies & music, as well as 351 billion archived web pages. OpenArchive is a collaboration with the Internet Archive, but is an independent project.</p>

<p>OpenArchive is a project dedicated to the ethical collection and long-term preservation of mobile media. <span class="appName">Save</span> (share, archive, verify, encrypt) is the mobile application we’ve created to do this. <span class="appName">Save</span> enables people to send media to multiple backends, including, but not limited to, the Internet Archive and other destinations of their choice. This option enables people to create public or private media collections.</p>

    <div class="heading"><h2>Why not social media?</h2></div>
    <div class="content">
      <p><i>Social media often exposes at-risk sources</i>: while major social media platforms can amplify content to a large audience, they can also expose sources to unwanted identification. Individuals shown or otherwise implicated in videos, photos, or audio clips may be targeted on- or offline.</p>

      <p><i>Social media can make it difficult to authenticate or verify media</i>: these sites often strip metadata from uploaded content. Metadata typically includes information about where media was captured, on what device, uploaded by whom, etc. While scrubbing metadata during upload is often a welcome privacy-enhancing feature for social media platforms (metadata can, for example, expose the identity of an uploader who would like to remain anonymous or pseudonymous), the practice also makes media authentication and verification more difficult. <span class="appName">Save</span> integrates the Proofmode functionalities, which ensure that robust metadata is captured and stored in a way that the user has control over.</p>

      <p><i>Media gets lost on social media platforms</i>: this makes it difficult to contextualize or organize media for easy access in the future.</p>

      <p><i>Social Media is not committed to long-term preservation</i>: companies go out of business, take down media, and moderate content.</p>

    <div class="heading"><h2>Why use Save by OpenArchive?</h2></div>
    <div class="content">
      <h5>Save addresses the following threat models</h5>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Loss of data.</em> Both digital and analog data face ongoing threats, including:
          <ol>
<li>Attack (e.g. theft, manipulation, surveillance, sabotage and intentional destruction);</li>
<li>Loss (e.g. hard drive failure, misplaced USB stick); and</li>
<li>Incidental destruction (e.g. natural disaster, water-based damage, mold). Save helps protect against these threats by providing users a way to create multiple backups of important data and distribute them across geographically and jurisdictionally diverse servers.</li>
</ol>
      </li>
<li><em>Single point of failure.</em> Keeping data in one place increases the likelihood that any of the above scenarios may lead to an inability to use or access important data. Save distributes its backups so that if one fails, the data will still be available elsewhere.</li>
        <li><em>Network surveillance/+Censorship.</em> Users may want to protect their content, identity, and/or activities from those who may be watching them, like governments, private companies, or untrusted individuals. Save is designed to run over the <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor network</a>, which promotes privacy by encrypting data transfers and protecting against traffic analysis.</li>
      <li><em>Inauthentic or unverified content.</em> Unverified content can lead to false conclusions, and can affect one’s credibility. Save incorporates <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/blob/master/README.md">ProofMode</a>, a feature that supports robust verification and authentication practices.
<li><em>Lack of internet connectivity.</em> Without a data connection--whether because of remote working conditions or internet shutdowns--sharing data can be difficult and cumbersome. Save enables users to share data with nearby devices via Bluetooth, even when not connected to wifi or cellular data.
      <li><em>Network hardening.</em> Locking down the TLS connection so we only support the latest TLS 1.3. We do our best to harden your network connection by configuring TLS settings.</li>
      </ol>
