<p><b>OpenArchive launches new app <span class="appName">Save</span> to help journalists and human rights advocates 
protect and preserve highly sensitive digital media</b></p>

<p>OpenArchive, an organization dedicated to advancing freedom of digital expression, announced today the 
release of a new mobile application, <span class="appName">Save</span>, that safeguards digital evidence of 
human rights abuses around the world.</p>
<br>
<p>As police violently crack down on peaceful protests, social media companies 
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/11/02/war-crimes-youtube-facebook-syria-rohingya/">censor evidence of war crimes</a>, 
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/iraq-blocks-facebook-whatsapp-cuts-internet-protests-2019-10?r=US&IR=T">national telecom services are suspended</a> 
in times of unrest, and governments seek to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/19/myanmar-government-bulldozing-rohingya-mass-grave-hide-evidence">suppress documentary evidence of atrocities</a>, 
witnesses capturing media on mobile phones play a key role in exposing injustice during turbulent times around the world. <span class="appName">Save</span> 
makes it easy for journalists, activists, lawyers and others to safely store, share, preserve and amplify documentation of human rights injustices without fear of censorship, surveillance or retribution.</p>

<p>The app, which is available for free through iTunes and Google Play, fills an urgent need among individuals and organizations for an alternative to mainstream technologies 
that can enable free and reliable sharing of evidence of human atrocities and in ways that are easily accessed and managed.</p>

<p>“Organizations with distributed teams face challenges in aggregating, indexing and cataloging their communities’ digitally-captured content into particular workflows, often in and from dangerous locations,” 
says Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Director of OpenArchive and a fellow at the Stanford Digital Civil Society Lab.</p>

<p>For Cadranel and organizations she works with such as Human Rights Watch, the success of Save will be measured in what the tool can provide to human rights defenders; the app’s inception was a direct response 
to mounting efforts worldwide to suppress dissent through police crackdowns on peaceful protests, censorship by governments and social media companies, telecom services outages and other forms of retaliation.</p>

<p><span class="appName">Save</span> offers several innovative features. While those using <span class="appName">Save</span> can store their mobile media on the Internet Archive, they also have the ability to 
integrate the app into their existing server-side preservation architecture. This provides security-minded individuals and teams with a revolutionary “off the shelf” front-end solution for curating their media 
from around the world. Whether hosted on individual servers or integrated with an organization’s existing technical infrastructure, <span class="appName">Save</span> is engineered to create robust redundancy 
for mobile-captured media content.</p>

<p>Unlike most of today’s major media hosting platforms, we built <span class="appName">Save</span> because we value human rights over corporate profits. We put power back into the hands of those on the front lines by 
streamlining media workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting. This means that the information sent through it cannot be censored, blocked or arbitrarily deleted.</p>

<p>“The <span class="appName">Save</span> app fills a long-standing need to provide secure, fully encrypted and self-hosted file transfer for our staff all over the world,” says Nicole Martin, 
Senior Manager of Archives and Digital Systems at Human Rights Watch. “OpenArchive carefully listened to our needs, built an intuitive app, and tailored its features to make human rights data safer, 
and my job a whole lot easier."</p>

<p>Funded through public interest advocates, <span class="appName">Save</span> was developed with extensive  community input by a team of open source developers, human rights archivists, 
internet ethnographers, digital security experts, technologists, journalists and international civil society members.</p>
