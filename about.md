<h2 class="textTeal">Mission</h2>
<p>OpenArchive preserves, amplifies, and securely routes mobile media to user-created collections in an accessible public trust, outside the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem.</p>
<p>Created for citizen journalists and human rights defenders, our distributed media ecosystem promotes freedom of expression by protecting at-risk community media, authenticating it, respecting its provenance, and offering long-term preservation and access to it.</p>
<p>
  </p>


<h2 class="textTeal">Vision</h2>
<p>People armed with mobile devices are becoming history’s first responders, amassing rich, contextualized, and crucial records of today’s breaking news. However, most of these recordings presently reside on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are subject to government censorship, privacy breaches, and data loss. While social media is an acceptable distribution platform, it does not provide sufficient privacy protections or archival preservation of this vital media.</p>

<p>We are doing better.</p>


<p>OpenArchive fosters a virtual commons where civil liberties are protected, in the process creating a world where the people’s history is a primary history.</p>

<p>
  </p>
<h2 class="textTeal">How It Works</h2>
<p>OpenArchive is a free, open source mobile archiving application for history’s first responders and human rights defenders that securely sends mobile media to the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, other online destinations using Orbot/Tor. By uniting the work of the <a href="http://guardianproject.info/">Guardian Project</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, and distributed, secure servers, it offers at-risk groups more agency and control of their historical record by affording them secure transit, media authentication, pseudonymity, licensing controls, and the ability to choose where and how the media will be stored for long-term access and reuse. In addition to this, those with limited internet access, can share media between devices with our “nearby” feature via bluetooth, so there can be multiple copies of the media across devices.</p>
<p>It is currently available for android on <a href="http://bit.ly/29ewnaD">Google Play</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/29jDPDo">Github</a>. Our lightweight mobile app. (under 3mb) addresses the gaps in the current online ecosystem existing around the a) ethical short-term collection and b) long term preservation of sensitive mobile media. We provide mobile-centered, scalable, industry-standard, ethical, intuitive, easy to use tools for at-risk communities to pseudonymously preserve and authenticate their media so that it will be accessible and maintain its provenance in the future.</p>
