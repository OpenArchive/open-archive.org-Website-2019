<h2 style="text-align: center;">Our Work</h2>
<h4 class="textTeal">Mission</h4>
<p>OpenArchive is dedicated to protecting media freedom: preserving, amplifying, and securely routing mobile media to community-maintained collections in accessible public and private archives, outside the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem.</p>
<p>Created by and for citizen reporters and human rights defenders in 2015, our distributed media ecosystem promotes freedom of expression by protecting, authenticating, and offering access to and long-term preservation of at-risk community media.</p>
<p>
  </p>

<h4 class="textTeal">Vision</h4>
<p>People armed with mobile devices are becoming history’s first responders, amassing rich, contextualized, and crucial records of today’s breaking news. However, most of these recordings presently reside on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are subject to government censorship, privacy breaches, and data loss. While social media is an acceptable distribution platform, it does not provide sufficient privacy protections or archival preservation of this vital media.</p>

<p>We are doing better.</p>

<p>OpenArchive fosters a virtual commons where civil liberties are protected and aspires to create a world where people’s history is a primary history.</p>

<p>
  </p>
<h4 class="textTeal">Application</h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://open-archive.org/save/"> <span class="appName">Save</span></a> by OpenArchive is a free, open source mobile archiving application for documentarians and human rights defenders that securely sends mobile media to the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, other online destinations using Orbot/Tor. By uniting the work of the <a href="http://guardianproject.info/">Guardian Project</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, and distributed, secure servers, it offers at-risk groups more agency over their historical record by affording them secure transit, media authentication, pseudonymity, licensing controls, and the ability to choose where and how the media will be stored for long-term access and reuse. In addition to this, those with limited internet access, can share media between devices with our “nearby” feature via bluetooth, so there can be multiple copies of the media across devices.</p>
<p>It is currently available for iOS on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/save-by-openarchive/id1462212414">iTunes</a>, android on <a href="http://bit.ly/29ewnaD">Google Play</a>, and at <a href="http://bit.ly/29jDPDo">GitHub</a>. Our lightweight mobile app. addresses the gaps in the current online ecosystem existing around the a) ethical short-term collection and b) long term preservation of sensitive mobile media. We provide mobile-centered, scalable, industry-standard, ethical, intuitive, easy to use tools for at-risk communities to pseudonymously preserve and authenticate their media so that it will be accessible and maintain its provenance in the future.</p>

 <p><b>Tara Vassefi</b>
<br>

<p>Tara is a lawyer who has spent her career learning from human rights defenders, journalists, archivists, and technologists about methods and approaches to optimizing the use of digital evidence for legal accountability and advocacy measures. She began this work at the <a href="https://www.wcl.american.edu/impact/initiatives-programs/warcrimes/" target="_blank">War Crimes Research Office</a>, in the aftermath of the 2011 Arab Uprisings when no court had substantively weighed the evidentiary value of a YouTube video or Facebook post. After law school, she worked with <a href="https://vae.witness.org/about-video-as-evidence/" target="_blank">WITNESS</a>, a human rights documentation organization, focusing on <a href="https://www.pilnet.org/images/mena/vae_in_mena_full%20report_final.pdf" target="_blank">Video as Evidence in the Middle East and North Africa</a>. Following this foundational understanding of localized approaches to optimizing digital evidence, she expanded her work to include other innovative solutions and how they might be mindfully leveraged for human rights accountability, from blockchain to open source investigations to Computer Vision. While at UC Berkeley Law Schools <a href="https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/students/hrc-investigations-lab" target="_blank">Human Rights Center - Investigations Lab</a>, she became particularly interested in authentication solutions and was later brought on as the Legal Scholar and Washington Director of Strategic Initiatives for Truepic, a tech startup specializing in digital image authentication. Having since left that position with Truepic, she joins OpenArchive's Board to work closely with our partners on the ground and help support our mission.
